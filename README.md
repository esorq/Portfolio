## Introduction
------------------
As an aspiring Data Scientist and Machine Leraning engineer, I build this personal Data Science and Machine Learning portfolio to share learnings, experiences and collaborate with people who have the same interest in this field. 

I have a backgorund in the mechanical engineering field which sometimes can be seen from the nature of the problems in this portfolio.
